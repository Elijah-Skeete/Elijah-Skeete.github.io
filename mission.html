		<p><font size="4">Our Mission is to set God&#39;s people free by teaching and preaching the Word of God as it relates
                     to the Power and Anointing of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; God opened Chimain&#39;s spiritual eyes several years ago&nbsp;and told
                     her that there is more in the Kingdom of God.&nbsp; God spoke to her Spirit every day with these words, &quot;There is More&quot;.&nbsp;
                     Therefore, she began to pray, fast and study for&nbsp;a clear understanding and revelation about the words God spoke in her
                     Spirit.&nbsp; God placed a message in her heart, and that message was, &quot;Go Set My People Free&quot;.&nbsp; He said, &quot;Go
                     tell my people, I have already set them free, and that there is no bondage, no lack, and no&nbsp;excuses&quot;.&nbsp; He said
                     that everything has already been done, if my people will just &quot;believe&quot;, and &quot;walk by faith&quot;.&nbsp; God
                     also revealed that in setting His people free, teach them that there is greater power, greater anointing and greater works
                     to do for God.&nbsp; The Power of the Holy Spirit is at hand and lives in all Christians, and it is time to operate in the
                     Anointing and Power of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></font></p><p><font size="4"><br />God said it is time for my people
                     to operate in the Power that resides in them.&nbsp; It is time for the blind to see, the dead to be raised, the sick to be
                     healed and the lame to walk.&nbsp;It is time&nbsp;for miracles, signs and wonders. &nbsp;It is time to reveal His mystery,
                     and that mystery is Jesus Christ lives in us, the hope of Glory, and the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead, resides
                     in us, and that greater works shall we do.&nbsp; He has sent forth the Holy Spirit to be our comforter, our teacher, and our
                     helper.&nbsp; It is time to walk by the Spirit and not the flesh, to know how to discern the voice of God, and to be obedient
                     to what He has called us to do.&nbsp; Mrs. Douglas has laid hands on hundreds of people&nbsp;that the scales will fall off
                     their eyes and that people will see at another level</font>.<br />&nbsp;<br /><font size="4"><em>Matthew 13:14 &quot;Hearing
                     you will hear and shall not understand, and seeing you will see and not perceive,&nbsp; For the hearts of this people have
                     grown dull.&nbsp; Their ears are hard of hearing and their eyes they have closed.&nbsp; Lest they should see with their eyes
                     and hear with their ears.&nbsp; Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn so that I should heal them.&nbsp; But,
                     blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear.&nbsp; But assuredly, I say to you that many prophets and righteous
                     men desired to see and did not see it, and to hear what you hear and did not hear it&quot;.<br /><br /><font face="terminal,monaco">I
                     believe that God has given us the ability to see the invisible, to accomplish the impossible, and achieve the unimaginable
