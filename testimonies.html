         size="3"><em>-Pastor Chimain Douglas is such a blessing to our Ministry.&nbsp; She came in and taught about the Power and
         Anointing of the Holy Spirit in such a way that our members begin to want to take their walk with God to a HIGHER LEVEL, by
         tuning into the HOLY SPIRIT!&nbsp; We are now pastoring a mature congregation that understands the true meaning of the FATHER,
         SON, AND HOLY SPIRIT! <br />- Pastor George &amp; Tanya Lawrence, New Breed Ministries.<br /><br />-Chimain Douglas laid hands
         on five women at my home who wanted to have children, but could not due to medical reasons,&nbsp; She prophesized that all
         five women would conceive within that same year.&nbsp; All 5 women conceived in that same year and all delivered healthy children.&nbsp;
         The Lord moved mightily through Chimain on that day and it was definitely proof that God hears our prayers! <br />- Pam Douglas<br
         /><br />-I attended Minister Douglas&#39; prayer service held on Feb 5, 2011.&nbsp; She is a Holy Spirit filled woman of GOD
         who is passionate about helping others go to another level in God.&nbsp; Minister Douglas has such a witty yet serious style
         as she delivers her message, allowing all who hear it to understand and thirst for more.&nbsp; I encourage you to attend one
         of her next services.&nbsp; I am a witness that you will not leave the way you came!&nbsp; -Janina Walton, Wise Wealthy Women
         Organization<br /><br />-Chimain, you have been an absolute blessing to me since we started working together. When I first
         saw you the Spirit said &quot;help her&quot;, but little did I know you were helping me!&nbsp; I always prayed for God to
         send me someone that could push me into my destiny and he sent you.&nbsp; I asked you to pray that God would send me a Godly
         husband, but that particular day the Spirit would not let you pray for a husband , He told you to pray for my ministry to
         come forward first.&nbsp; You were obedient to the Spirit of God.&nbsp; You laid hands and prophesized over me and I fell
         out in the Spirit and every since that day, I have never been the same.&nbsp; God has taken me to another level and I am on
         fire for the Lord.&nbsp; He has taken me into the deep treasures of His Word and given me boldness like never before.&nbsp;
         Because of your obedience, I am on my road to my destiny.&nbsp; The blessing did not stop there, when you came over to my
         house (you did not know that my son did drugs), but you prayed that God would take the taste out of his mouth for drugs.&nbsp;
         Well, I am here to say that the taste is gone, he has been delivered, he&#39;s drug free (within 6 months of your prophecy).&nbsp;
         He&#39;s Drug Free.&nbsp; Praise the Lord!!!<br />-Prophetess/Minister, Teretha Harris, Multi-Millionaire for the Kingdom<br
         /><br />-Chimain has truly helped me develop my relationship with the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Her teaching is sincere.&nbsp; Her
         passion for the things of God is authentic and is obvious in her daily life.&nbsp; I have been blessed by the Ministry and
         would encourage anyone who is looking to move to another level with God to come to one of her services.&nbsp;<br />&quot;You
         will not be the same&quot; <br />- Wallette V. McCall - Another Level Coaching, LLC<br /><br />-I have known Chimain Douglas
         for more than 20 years, and her ministry has been a tremendous blessing to me and my family.&nbsp; God has anointed Chimain
         with a special gift to see the impossible and make it a reality.&nbsp; Through her years as my friend and counselor, God has
         allowed her to show me His awesome power and how He can bring healing and wholeness to any circumstances.&nbsp; Her love for
         God and her desire to see His people free are truly anointed by the Holy Spirit.<br />- Dr. LaVonne&nbsp;V. Hester-Smith,
         Ph.D.<br /><br />-Chimain Douglas Ministries has been a tremendous blessing to me.&nbsp; I have seen the&nbsp;power&nbsp;of
         God move in her life and how&nbsp;she has touched so many lives.&nbsp; She is a truly anointed woman of God ordained to spread
         God&#39;s&nbsp;Word.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, I have seen her grow into a powerful woman of God that teaches the&nbsp;Word
         with understanding.&nbsp; She has such a strong compassion to see people come to Christ and live a productive Christian life
         that will edify the body of Christ.&nbsp; Her gift and anointing have inspired me and impacted my life in so many ways.&nbsp;Her
         motto has always been to &quot;teach the people and set them free from bondage&quot;<br />&nbsp;- Minister Nathaniel Hackett,
         Lakewin Christian Center<br /><br />-Minister Douglas is an awesome woman of God!&nbsp; She radically ministers the Word of
         God and truly touches the untouched with her message from the Lord to set His people free from bondage financially and spiritually!&nbsp;
         She is genuinely affecting the Kingdom without compromise of character as she speaks transparently.&nbsp; She is truly changing
         the lives of God&#39;s people <br />- Tomicka Yates, Christian Women&#39;s Investment Association <br /><br />-I have known
         Minister Douglas for 30 years and I can truly say that to know her is to love her.&nbsp; She is a woman of faith, hope, love,
         and integrity.&nbsp; Minister Douglas has been summoned by God to deliver such a word in her bible studies, conferences, and
         other speaking engagements have enhanced all of our lives, and no matter what she faces, her unshaken faith continues to say,
         &quot;I&#39;ve got to tell the people what thus saith the Lord&quot; <br />- Darlene Caffey, Destiny Production and Publishing
         Co.<br /><br />-Chimain, I can&#39;t thank you enough for all you have done and continue to do for me.&nbsp; You literally
         saved my life by sticking with me all of those years and showing me what God really look like here on earth.&nbsp; Keep listening
         to God and being obedient.&nbsp; Because if you don&#39;t, it may cost someone their life!&nbsp; I am so glad you were obedient
         when you told me about Him.&nbsp; Where would I be today had you not showed Him to me - &quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot;&nbsp;
         God is still using you to bless people.&nbsp; You are truly a blessing to a lot of people.&nbsp; You introduced me to Christ
         and you continue to disciple me to be the Christian wife and mother that I am today.&nbsp; I am so grateful to have you in
         my life as my Spiritual Leader, Mentor, and Friend <br />- Andrea Hayes<br /><br /><br />I thank God for these testimonies
         and they are truly a blessing.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not about me, but GOD the Father, Jesus Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;
         In Him, I live, move and have my being.&nbsp; Father God, continue to use me Lord for your Glory.&nbsp; Allow me to be your
         mouthpiece, your servant, and your vessel.&nbsp; I love you Lord with all of my heart and I am so grateful that you have chosen
         me to do a work for you.&nbsp; Let everything I do, be pleasing in your sight.&nbsp; You are the Lord of Lord, King of Kings,
         The Alpha and Omega, The Beginning and The End, and&nbsp;The First and The Last.&nbsp; Amen! <br />-&nbsp;Minister Chimain

         others with the power He has given you.&nbsp; Our goal was to change people&#39;s lives and without a doubt you, along with
